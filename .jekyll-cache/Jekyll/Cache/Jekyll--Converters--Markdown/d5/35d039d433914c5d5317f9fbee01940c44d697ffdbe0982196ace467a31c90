<h2>two trackS</h2>

<p>This year we will have two tracks again. The pro track is for <em>experienced jam participants</em>; you need to make a game thatâ€™s more or less playable in 7 days. The newbie track is for <em>beginners</em>; you will present your ideas with a prototypical demo in a 12 hour sprint. You can only participate in <strong>one</strong> of them.</p>

<h3>pro track:</h3>
